Second project FreeCodeCamp to valid the certification "Data Visualization"

**User Story :**

# Content

- User Story #1: I can see a title element that has a corresponding id="title". ✅

- User Story #2: I can see an x-axis that has a corresponding id="x-axis". ✅

- User Story #3: I can see a y-axis that has a corresponding id="y-axis". ✅

- User Story #4: I can see dots, that each have a class of dot, which represent the data being plotted. ✅

- User Story #5: Each dot should have the properties data-xvalue and data-yvalue containing their corresponding x and y values. ✅

- User Story #6: The data-xvalue and data-yvalue of each dot should be within the range of the actual data and in the correct data format. For data-xvalue, integers (full years) or Date objects are acceptable for test evaluation. For data-yvalue (minutes), use Date objects. ✅

- User Story #7: The data-xvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis. ✅

- User Story #8: The data-yvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis. ✅

- User Story #9: I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with %M:%S time format. ✅

- User Story #10: I can see multiple tick labels on the x-axis that show the year. ✅

- User Story #11: I can see that the range of the x-axis labels are within the range of the actual x-axis data. ✅

- User Story #12: I can see that the range of the y-axis labels are within the range of the actual y-axis data. ✅

- User Story #13: I can see a legend containing descriptive text that has id="legend". ❌

# TooltipTests

- User Story #14: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. ❌

- User Story #15: My tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-xvalue of the active area. ❌

# Dataset
